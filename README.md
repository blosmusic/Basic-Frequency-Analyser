# Basic Frequency Analyser

The app allows the user to view the frequency of a saved sound or upload an audio file to view the amplitube strength of a set number of bands.

The interface uses FFT analysis and is defaulted to 512 bands.
 
 The Frequency Analyser is based on tutorial guides from MDN and the [JavaScript Audio CRASH COURSE For Beginners] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXWvfrmpapI&list=PL8b-iIuZnsuHmJjQYH180EBrCYUdQMQ7S&index=40&t=30s)
